### This repository contains some of the coding challenges found in HackerRank. 
#### All the programs have passed all the test cases found in HackerRank. A brief desription of what the program is about is found in the comments.
#### I have also named the files similar to how they have been named on HackerRank.
#### The master branch contains normal coding challenges whereas the dynamic branch has challenges which have dynamic solutions. Most had recursive solutions but they were not efficient and thus did not pass the test cases.
